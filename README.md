### Hosting on EC2 with IAM Role for S3 Access

1. **Launch an EC2 instance**:
    - Launch an EC2 instance with Amazon Linux 2 AMI.
    - Configure security group to allow inbound traffic on port 8099.

2. **Create an IAM role**:
    - Go to the IAM console and create a new role.
    - Select "AWS service" and "EC2" as the use case.
    - Attach the "AmazonS3FullAccess" policy or a custom policy that allows S3 access.
    - Complete the role creation process.

3. **Attach the IAM role to your EC2 instance**:
    - Go to the EC2 console.
    - Select your instance, click "Actions," then "Security," and "Modify IAM role."
    - Select the IAM role you created and attach it to the instance.

4. **Connect to your EC2 instance**:
    ```sh
    ssh -i /path/to/your-key-pair.pem ec2-user@your-ec2-public-dns
    ```

5. **Install necessary packages**:
    ```sh
    sudo yum update -y
    sudo yum install python3 python3-venv git -y
    ```

6. **Clone the repository and set up the environment**:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/Kdarks3215/weather_dashboard.git
    cd weather_dashboard
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

7. **Set environment variables**:
    - Create a `.env` file with your OpenWeather API key and S3 bucket name (no need for AWS credentials as the IAM role handles access).
    ```plaintext
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key
    AWS_BUCKET_NAME=your_aws_s3_bucket_name
    ```

8. **Run the app with Gunicorn**:
    ```sh
    nohup gunicorn -w 2 -b 0.0.0.0:8099 app:server &
